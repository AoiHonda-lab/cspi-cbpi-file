# Neural Coalition Index

This repository provides implementations of:
- **Coalition-based Shapley Pivot Index (CSPI)**
- **Class-based Banzhaf Pivot Index (CBPI)**

These methods are designed to interpret multi-class classification tasks based on game-theoretic pivot concepts.

## Structure

- `cspi/`: Core implementation of CSPI
- `cbpi/`: Core implementation of CBPI
- `examples/`: Example notebooks for each method

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-coalition-index.git
cd neural-coalition-index
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

See `examples/cspi_example.ipynb` and `examples/cbpi_example.ipynb`.
